; TODO: Folds in Markdown files will have to wait until we can add "tags" to
; divided folds. We want an H1 section to be able to fold up everything until
; the next H1 in the file, an H2 to fold up everything until the next H2 _or_
; H1, an H3 to fold up everything until the next H3 _or_ H2 _or_ H1â€¦ but this
; is not currently possible.
